<h1 align="center">Open Claude Tag — The open-source Claude Tag alternative</h1>

> 🔥 **Claude Tag launched June 23, 2026** — Anthropic's always-on AI teammate that lives in Slack, learns your company, and works autonomously. It's closed, paid, locked to Anthropic, and cloud-only. This is the open-source alternative: self-hostable, LLM-agnostic, and channel-native.

**Open Claude Tag** is a free, self-hostable AI teammate for Slack that works the way Claude Tag does — one shared agent per channel, persistent memory, skill auto-creation, ambient monitoring — without Anthropic's paywall, without cloud lock-in, without the single-vendor constraint.

> Most Slack AI bots are personal assistants — one context per user, isolated DMs. Open Claude Tag flips this: **one agent per channel, shared by the whole team.** Everyone sees the same context, picks up mid-thread, and the agent knows who said what.

## Why Open Claude Tag

> **On June 23, 2026, Anthropic released Claude Tag** — the first AI that joins Slack as a shared channel teammate rather than a personal DM bot. It went viral. But it stayed closed-source, paid-only, cloud-only, locked to Claude models, and locked to Anthropic's access control model. No self-host, no BYOK for other providers, no custom tool integrations without Anthropic's approval.

Open Claude Tag is the open-source alternative. Same channel-native mental model, none of the lock-in:

- 🏢 **Channel-scoped, not user-scoped.** One agent per channel, shared by the whole team. All users see the same context, pick up mid-thread.
- 🤖 **LLM-agnostic.** Use Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Groq, or local Ollama. Swap with one env var. Different channels can use different models.
- 💾 **Agent-curated memory.** After each conversation, the agent decides what's worth keeping in `MEMORY.md`. No noisy append-only logs.
- 🧠 **Skill auto-creation.** After complex multi-step tasks, the agent writes a `SKILL.md` capturing what it learned. Institutional knowledge accumulates automatically.
- 🔔 **Ambient monitoring.** Configurable heartbeat: the agent proactively surfaces stale threads, approaching deadlines, and forgotten questions.
- 🔌 **MCP-native tools.** Plug in any MCP server per channel. Admins control exactly what each channel's agent can access.
- 📁 **File-based config.** Each channel is a directory of Markdown files. Version-controllable, auditable, no UI required.
- 🔒 **Self-hostable.** Your Slack data stays on your infrastructure. No round-trips to Anthropic's cloud.

## How it Works

### The core inversion

Every other Slack bot keys sessions on `user_id`. Open Claude Tag keys sessions on `(workspace_id, channel_id)`. That one change is what makes it feel like a teammate rather than a chatbot.

```
[#engineering channel]

@alice  Can you review the PR for the auth refactor?
@agent  Sure. I pulled the PR — looks good overall, one concern:
        the session expiry logic on line 42 doesn't handle clock skew.
        @bob you mentioned this pattern in the DB migration last week —
        does the same fix apply here?
@bob    Yeah, add a 5s leeway. Same as auth/session.py:L88
@agent  Got it. Adding to MEMORY.md: "session expiry: always add 5s
        leeway for clock skew (pattern from auth/session.py:L88)"
```

Every user in the channel sees the same thread. The agent knows who said what, follows up with the right person, and decides what's worth remembering.

### Agent loop

```
Slack @mention
       │
       ▼
  Channel Router ──── (workspace_id + channel_id) → AgentSession
       │                  ↑ serialized lock: no parallel writes to context

  ├── Per-channel APScheduler crons
  ├── Heartbeat evaluator: "anything worth surfacing?"
  └── Proactive Slack post if yes, SILENT if no
```

### Memory architecture

```
Layer 1 — Context window (always loaded)
  CHANNEL.md + MEMORY.md + active SKILL.md files + last 50 messages

Layer 2 — Session store (SQLite + FTS5, per workspace)
  Full message history with user_id, timestamps, thread_ts
  Full-text search: "what did we decide about X last month?"

Layer 3 — Semantic recall (Mem0, Phase 2)
  Embeddings over key decisions and facts
  Namespace = channel_id (fully isolated per channel)

Layer 4 — Skill library (per channel)
  Auto-created after complex tasks (≥5 tool calls)
  Loaded into context when task description matches
  Curated weekly: stale after 30d, archived after 90d
```

### Ambient heartbeat

The heartbeat evaluator runs on a configurable cron per channel. It dumps recent activity to the LLM and asks: "anything worth surfacing?" It only posts if there's genuine value — stale threads, approaching deadlines, forgotten questions, spotted risks. Otherwise: `SILENT`.

The agent can also create its own monitoring tasks via `schedule_task(cron, description)` — it decides what's worth checking and when.

---

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A Slack app with Socket Mode enabled ([create one here](https://api.slack.com/apps))
- An API key for your preferred LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or Groq)

### 1. Create the Slack app

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) → **Create New App** → From scratch
2. **Settings → Socket Mode**: enable it and generate an App-Level Token (`xapp-...`) with `connections:write` scope
3. **Event Subscriptions**: enable and subscribe to `app_mention` and `message.channels`
4. **OAuth & Permissions → Bot Token Scopes**: add `app_mentions:read`, `channels:history`, `channels:read`, `chat:write`, `reactions:write`, `users:read`
5. Install to workspace → copy the Bot Token (`xoxb-...`)

### 2. Install and configure

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Anil-matcha/open-claude-tag
cd open-claude-tag

# Install
pip install -e .

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...

# Pick one LLM provider:
LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# or: LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o  +  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# or: LLM_MODEL=gemini/gemini-2.0-flash  +  GEMINI_API_KEY=...
# or: LLM_MODEL=ollama/llama3  (no key needed)
```

### 3. Configure your first channel

Get your channel ID: in Slack, right-click channel name → **View channel details** → scroll to the bottom.

```bash
mkdir -p data/channels/C01234ABC
cp channels/example/CHANNEL.md data/channels/C01234ABC/CHANNEL.md
# Edit CHANNEL.md to describe your channel's purpose and team
```

### 4. Run

```bash
tagopen
```

Then `@open-claude-tag` in your Slack channel.

---

## Channel Configuration

Each channel gets a directory of plain Markdown files under `data/channels/<channel_id>/`. Version-controllable, human-readable, no database required.

```
data/channels/C01234ABC/
  CHANNEL.md      ← identity, purpose, tone
  MEMORY.md       ← agent-maintained facts (auto-updated, don't edit manually)
  tools.toml      ← MCP servers and per-channel LLM override
  skills/         ← auto-created playbooks
    deploy-to-staging.md
    oncall-handoff.md
    pr-review-checklist.md
```

### CHANNEL.md

```markdown
# Engineering Channel

You are the engineering team's AI teammate in #engineering.

## Purpose
Help with deployments, code reviews, incident response, and architecture decisions.

## Tone
Technical, direct, concise. Use code blocks. Ask before triggering deploys.

## Team context
- Stack: Python backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL, AWS
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- We do not deploy on Fridays
```

### MEMORY.md — agent-curated facts

The agent writes this automatically. After each conversation it gets one internal LLM turn to decide what's worth persisting — using `memory_append` and `memory_replace` tools. Memory stays clean because the agent curates it, not a dumb append-only log.

Example of what accumulates over time:

```markdown
# Channel Memory

- Session expiry: always add 5s leeway for clock skew (auth/session.py:L88)
- We use squash-merge for all PRs — rebase main before merging
- Alice: infra questions. Bob: auth layer.
- Never restart worker pods on Fridays — cron runs at 11pm PT
```

### tools.toml — MCP servers and model override

```toml
# Per-channel LLM override (optional)
[llm]
model = "gpt-4o"

# MCP servers allowed in this channel
[[mcp_server]]
name = "github"
url = "mcp://localhost:3001"
allowed_tools = ["list_prs", "get_file", "create_comment", "trigger_workflow"]

[[mcp_server]]
name = "linear"
url = "mcp://localhost:3002"
allowed_tools = ["list_issues", "create_issue", "update_status"]
```

### Skills — auto-created institutional knowledge

After any task requiring 5+ tool calls, the agent writes a `SKILL.md`. Next time a similar task comes up, the skill loads into context automatically.

Example auto-created skill:

```markdown
---
name: deploy-to-staging
description: Deploy a service to staging via GitHub Actions
created: 2026-06-25
uses: 3
status: active
---

## When to use this
When someone asks to deploy a service to staging.

## Steps
1. Check CI is passing on the branch (github:list_prs)
2. Confirm with the requester before triggering
3. Trigger `deploy-staging` workflow (github:trigger_workflow)
4. Monitor the run for 2 minutes, post the staging URL

## Known gotchas
- No deploys on Fridays — check day of week first
- `worker` service uses a separate `deploy-worker` workflow
```

Skills lifecycle: active → stale (30d unused) → archived (90d). A weekly curator pass merges overlapping skills and patches outdated ones.

## Supported LLMs

Uses [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) — one interface for every provider. Set `LLM_MODEL` and the matching key:

| Provider | `LLM_MODEL` | Key env var |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Claude (default) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic Claude Opus | `claude-opus-4-8` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic Claude Haiku | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI GPT-4o | `gpt-4o` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI o3 | `o3` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google Gemini | `gemini/gemini-2.0-flash` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Groq (fast open-weight) | `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| Local Ollama | `ollama/llama3` | *(none needed)* |

**Per-channel model override** — run a lighter model in `#general`, a more powerful one in `#engineering`. Add to `data/channels/<id>/tools.toml`:

```toml
[llm]
model = "claude-opus-4-8"
```

Channels can also point at OpenAI-compatible endpoints, including self-hosted
gateways and cloud providers that expose the OpenAI chat completions API:

```toml
[llm]
model = "openai/ernie-4.5-turbo-32k"
api_base = "https://qianfan.baidubce.com/v2"
api_key_env = "QIANFAN_API_KEY"
```

`api_key_env` names the environment variable TagOpen should read at runtime, so
secrets stay out of channel config files.

---

## Built-in Tools

Always available in every channel — no configuration needed:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `web_search` | DuckDuckGo instant search — no API key required |
| `run_python` | Execute Python snippets and return stdout (sandboxed) |
| `search_channel_history` | Full-text search across this channel's message history |
| `memory_append` | Append a fact to `MEMORY.md` |
| `memory_replace` | Update an outdated fact in `MEMORY.md` |

Add any other tool by listing an MCP server in `tools.toml`. Any MCP-compatible server works — GitHub, Linear, Notion, Jira, Datadog, PagerDuty, Sentry, etc.
